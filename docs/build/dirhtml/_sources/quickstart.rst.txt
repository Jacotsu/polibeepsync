Quickstart
===========

After you've followed the instructions from the :doc:`installation` page
you can configure the application.

1. Insert usercode and password

   * Click "Try login credentials".
     If you get a text saying ``Successful login`` on the status bar then continue

2. Go to the ``Courses`` tab, click ``Refresh list``. Wait a few seconds.
   A list of all the available courses should come up. For every course,
   you can choose to synchronize it by checking the corresponding checkbox;
   you can also choose the folder name under which every file belonging to
   the course should be saved. Two different courses can't use the same
   folder.

3. Go back to the ``Settings`` tab, press the ``Change`` button
   if you don't like the predefined root folder (i.e the folder under which
   every course is saved). The other options should be self-explanatory.

4. Press ``Sync now`` to start the first synchronization.
