  With this fix, after the user changes the root folder, files get
  downloaded to the new selected folder, instead of the old one.

- Fix typo in filename. [Davide Olianas]

- Test script: test only useful files. [Davide Olianas]

- BUGFIX: correct behaviour when refreshing courses. [Davide Olianas]

  Before this fix, the "ok signal" from loginthread is not disconnected
  from do_refreshcourses; therefore, the next time the user presses "try
  login credentials", the function do_refreshcourses gets called.  The
  function do_refreshcourses should be called only when the ok signal is
  emitted from the loginthread started by refreshcourses.

- Connect ok/error signals to both login status and status textbox.
  [Davide Olianas]

- Remove old comments from LoginThread. [Davide Olianas]

- Use myStream_message function to add text to "status" [Davide Olianas]

  Moved code to MainWindow definition; use threads for login and courses
  synchronization

- New class style for common classes. [Davide Olianas]

- Change in filesettings defaults and updated unit tests. [Davide
  Olianas]

- Function to save a folder recursively +  tweaks. [Davide Olianas]

  The function is not tested yet; other tweaks are  * helper function to
  get the modification date for a local file * new courses created
  default to sync=False * updated docstring for logout()

- Add functionality to GUI. [Davide Olianas]

  * implemented insertRows and removeRows to update the view when new
  courses are available or when some should be removed * load username,
  password, courses list from "data" file * testlogin() ensures that the
  user is logged * refreshcourses() synces the local state of data with
  the remote website * syncfiles() should be able to download files to
  local directories (not tested)

- Default text for login information label. [Davide Olianas]

- Ok button hides window. [Davide Olianas]

- __init__.py re-inserted and renamed polibeepsync to common. [Davide

- A better resizable window. [Davide Olianas]

- Almost working courses tab. [Davide Olianas]

  Also add icons and some auxiliary script to understand tableview and
  model.

  [Davide Olianas]

- Simple functions to load/save settings and files rename. [Davide
  Olianas]

- Start working on GUI. [Davide Olianas]

- It can get all files available online. [Davide Olianas]

- Better documentation and few PEP-8 corrections. [Davide Olianas]

- Function to sync courses, with tests. [Davide Olianas]

- Automatic documentation for polibeepsync package. [Davide Olianas]

- Move sphinx conf.py back to original folder. [Davide Olianas]

  ...and create script to build documentation

- Don't require a real account to test with behave. [Davide Olianas]

  Tests should not rely on an actual connection, or on a real account.
  Only scenarios tagged with "require_login" will get a User instance in
  the scenario context, already logged in.  In order to run such tests,
  a real account is needed. If you have one, you can test them by
  invoking behave like this  $ USERCODE=yourusercode
  PASSWORD=yourpassword\ behave --tags=require_login  Of course, you
  need to replace "yourusercode" and "yourpassword" with, guess what,
  your real usercode and password. Please note that shells usually
  record the typed commands and make them available through the
  "history" command.

- Update available courses avoids adding BeeP channel. [Davide Olianas]

- Use the Courses class in "User" instead of list. [Davide Olianas]

- Some fixes for Course and GenericSet. [Davide Olianas]

  Define __len__ for GenericSet. In Courses, override the init function
  in the correct way (by calling the init function of the parent class
  GenericSet). In Courses, define a property "files" which is a nicer
  name for the "elements" instance attribute.

- Fix typo in readme. [Davide Olianas]

- Update license and readme. [Davide Olianas]

- Updated requirements and test-requirements. [Davide Olianas]

- Move Sphinx configuration file. [Davide Olianas]

- Initial documentation. [Davide Olianas]

- Add shebang to test_all.sh script. [Davide Olianas]

- Change import statements in behave tests. [Davide Olianas]

  This is due to the change in package organization (the subfloder
  polibeepsync now contains everything)

- Coverage settings, script to run all tests, update test-requirements.
  [Davide Olianas]

  Also ignore coverage html reports and coverage internal files

- Unit tests for custom classes. [Davide Olianas]

- Move files to subfolder, including tests. [Davide Olianas]

- Automatically login when page is requested and session has expired.
  [Davide Olianas]

  Also, a handy logout() function is defined. For now, the only needed
  action is clearing session cookies.

- PEP-8 corrections. [Davide Olianas]

- Write helper function to re-login when necessary. [Davide Olianas]

- Login function doesn't require SSL_JSESSIONID cookie. [Davide Olianas]

- Given a valid session, I get the available courses. [Davide Olianas]

- Login with requests only. [Davide Olianas]

- Rewrite environment.py and avoid selenium. [Davide Olianas]

  It's actually possible to use requests exclusively, thus selenium is
  removed. The enviroment.py of behave runs "before_all_scenarios" which
  basically does the login procedure; it's not executed in the scenarios
  tagged with 'login'.

- Update gitignore to ignore common temporary files. [Davide Olianas]

- Module setup with basic script. [Davide Olianas]

- Initial features. [Davide Olianas]

- PySide added to pip requirements. [Davide Olianas]

- Remove additional requirements file. [Davide Olianas]

  If qmake can be found in $PATH, pyside installs without additional
  options; therefore I deleted "custom-requirements.txt" which was
  executed with the additional option --qmake=PATH_TO_QMAKE

- Custom requirements for pyside in separate file. [Davide Olianas]

- PySide added to requirements: fix typo. [Davide Olianas]

- PySide added to requirements. [Davide Olianas]
